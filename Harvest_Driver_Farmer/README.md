# Harvest - Farmer’s Market Delivery Service

## Description
Here at Harvest, we believe that farm fresh should be for everyone. Harvest aims to deliver the best quality produce right to your door no matter the weather, location or time. We work directly with Farmers’ Markets and local farmers to provide Angelenos a convenient way to order fresh and local produce as easily as any take-out meal.

Harvest is an iOS app that provides farm produce delivery service, similar to popular apps, such as “Postmates” and “DoorDash.” Harvest was founded by 4 Iovine and Young Academy students at USC. Over six months, the team has been conducting research, connecting with business partners, testing the product, and preparing clickable prototypes. 

Harvest is developed in two applications for both customer and business versions, where the business version provides service to the farm vendors and the drivers.

The major features of **Harvest - Customer Side** include:
- Users can browse different markets and choose from available vendors, browse selection and edit quantity, add to cart and pay for product and delivery fee.
- Users can schedule delivery date/time if markets are not open.
- Users can receive updates on delivery, message and tip drivers.
